#Overview

The goal of our group project is to create a water based navigation tool for lake goers in the Lake of the Ozarks. An application, while on water, to help find nearby points of interests(POI) is currently quite limited. As a group, we are focused on allowing users a more detailed look at the sights and entertainment along the water front of the Lake of the Ozarks and provide the functionality through Google APIs to help get you there. 

#Features
User-login: Allow users to save the locations they've visited.

POI-Descriptions: See descriptions of the resturants/sights along the water-front. See if they are open, the type of food they server, if they are kid friendly etc. 

Navigation: Help boat-goers find their way to the POIs along the water. How far is it, and how long should it aproximately take to get there? 

#Technologies
We'll be writing this program in Java, while possibly taking the time to learn some JS.

#What We'll Learn
Google API integration is a large part of the project as well as basic JS to create JSON's to populate resturant data on the map.
